# Magic Eden Listings App

---

## What is this project?

This is my second mini-project in my Go journey.

Each project is done via a task generated by ChatGPT, which is in a PDF file that can be found in the code section.

## How does it work?

Listings is a CLI application which calls the MagicEden API and fetches the listings of specified collections. Data is then exported to a CSV or JSON file.

## Usage

```shutup
Usage: ./listings <parameters> <collection1> <collection2> ... <collectionX>

Possible parameters:
    --limit <integer>       Sets a limit to the amount of listings to fetch for each collection
    --min-price <number>    Filters listings with a minimum price
    --max-price <number>    Filters listings with a maximum price
    --desc                  Sort by price in descending order (default - ascending)
    --json                  Export data in JSON format
```

## Key points in my learning experience

In the making of this project I have reinforced:

- Concurrent workflow with channels, waitgroups and goroutines.
- Working with the MagicEden developer API
- HTTP GET requests and data fetching
- JSON Marshalling/Unmarshaling to and from structs
- Idiomatic workflow: error handling, concurrency
- Planning a modular project structure (writer, formatter, models, etc...)

I have learned:

- To write Unit Tests for Go modules
- Converting structured JSON data to CSV
- Working with file outputs
- Testing HTTP requests with HTTP server mocking
